# Beyond Babies: Pet Ownership as Thailand’s Emerging Customer Market
As birth rates in Thailand decline and pet ownership continues to rise, businesses face a key question:\
<b>Should we continue to focus on baby-related products, or expand into the growing pet market to sustain growth?</b>

## When Are Babies Born the Most in Thailand?
Before diving into pets, let’s look at the trends in newborns across Thailand (2015-01-31 to 2025-05-31).

<img width="4471" height="1466" alt="Baby_Born_all_region" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb60974d-1058-4409-aa70-78c7993239c5" />
<p align="center">
Figure 1: Number of Baby Born per month in Thailand (2015–2025).
</p>

<b>Insight:</b> Baby births in Thailand show a steady decline overall. However, certain months see <b>higher birth clusters</b>.\
To visualize this, we highlight the top 3 birth months each year.

<img width="4471" height="1466" alt="Baby_Born_all_region_with_top_3_marker" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/178697b3-377b-422c-9c84-2a98cb8920eb" />
<p align="center">

</p>

We also examined whether these peaks fall into a <b>consistent seasonal window</b>.

<img width="4471" height="1466" alt="Baby_Born_all_region_with_all_marker" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/40ce8d83-a21e-4855-9fc5-3046588bab40" />
<p align="center">
Figure 3: Top 3 baby birth months across years, highlighting August–October.
</p>

<b>Finding:</b> Most babies in Thailand are born between <b>August and October</b>.
### <b>Business Takeaway:</b> If your products target babies (toys, diapers, consumables), the best months to promote and advertise are August–October each year. This reduces ad costs while maximizing impact during peak demand.

## Do Birth Trends Differ by Region?
We then split Thailand into 6 regions: <b>North, Northeast, Central, East, South, and West</b>.
<img width="4470" height="1466" alt="Baby_Born_each_region" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1295b05c-9fae-4c1f-8485-35735ff016a3" />
<p align="center">
Figure 4: Baby births per month in each region (2015–2025).
</p>

When grouped, the trend still shows peaks in <b>August–October</b> across regions:

<p align="center">

</p>

### Conclusion: No matter the region, baby births peak in <b>August–October</b>, reinforcing the seasonal promotion opportunity.

## Thailand’s Aging Population
Next, we shift to <b>population structure</b>. Babies may be declining, but what about the elderly?

<img width="2108" height="1278" alt="Ratio_Age_under_60_and_60_at_2015" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b5b72541-0b6f-4411-914b-c506ba9c191c" />
<p align="center">

</p>

<img width="2108" height="1365" alt="Ratio_Age_under_60_and_60_at_2025" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0e32ebdc-2858-4159-ba3e-eb57576b09ff" />
<p align="center">
Figure 8: Population ratio under 60 vs. 60+ (2025).
</p>

### <b>Key Shift:</b> Elderly population increased by <b>6.6% in 10 years</b>, reaching <b>21.2% in 2025</b>

<img width="3701" height="1407" alt="population_distribution_2025" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4e4f72e9-816f-47d7-91a4-2a8a1c628fb0" />
<p align="center">
Figure 9: Population distribution in Thailand (2025).
</p>

The large group aged <b>45–59</b> today will soon transition into elderly consumers.

## Elderly Health & Market Implications
One specific product market is <b>adult diapers</b> (urinary incontinence).

<img width="2970" height="1765" alt="Ratio_Urinary_Incontinence_Elderly" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c550fd14-d6d5-4db5-b134-2f362c8c0635" />
<p align="center">
Figure 10: Elderly urinary incontinence ratio.
</p>

Interestingly, while elderly numbers grow, the share suffering from incontinence <b>dropped from 21.8% (2014) to 12.5% (2024)</b>.

<img width="3571" height="1765" alt="Urinary_Incontinence_Elderly_with_cluster" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/61b7247b-3ca5-4a7c-9197-ea05efeb97d2" />
<p align="center">
Figure 11: Breakdown by elderly age groups.
</p>

Younger seniors (60–69) show <b>improved health habits</b>, reducing product demand compared to older generations.

When compared with babies (0–2 years old):

<p align="center">
Figure 13: Ratio comparison between babies and elderly with incontinence.
</p>

By 2024, this combined market <b>declined 16.4% vs. 2021</b>.\
In fact, the elderly with incontinence now <b>outnumber babies</b>, about <b>55% vs. 45%</b>.

### <b>Business Risk:</b> Companies focusing only on diapers (for babies or elderly) face shrinking markets.

## The Rise of Pets as Customers
Now, let’s compare with <b>pets (dogs & cats)</b>. 

<img width="4470" height="1765" alt="Number_of_Dog_Cat" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/776d6f77-1520-4ec6-8d0b-25b4785ffd0a" />
<p align="center">
Figure 14: Dogs, cats, and total pets in Thailand.
</p>

From 2024 to 2025:
- Dogs increased <b>+26.1%</b>
- Cats increased <b>+36.3%</b>
- Overall pet ownership rose <b>+29.6%</b>

Comparing long-term trends:

<p align="center">
Figure 16: Pet ownership trend.
</p>

Babies: decline by <b>~31,336 per year (~85 per day)</b>\
Pets: increase by <b>~1,871 per day (dogs +1,001, cats +869)</b>

## Final Insights for Businesses
- <b>Baby market:</b> shrinking due to declining birth rates.
- <b>Elderly health products:</b> growing population, but not all conditions (e.g., incontinence) follow the same growth.
- <b>Pet market:</b> fastest-growing, strong demand for products and services.

<b>Opportunity:</b> If your business currently focuses on baby products (toys, strollers, cribs, diapers), consider <b>expanding into the pet market</b>.
The <b>skills, supply chains, and customer understanding</b> you already have can be adapted to pet accessories, food, and care products—creating new revenue streams in Thailand’s changing demographic landscape.
